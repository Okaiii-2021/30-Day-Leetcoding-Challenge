An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.<br>

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.<br>
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.<br>

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.<br>

For example: <br>
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]<br>
Output: 3<br>
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself<br>
